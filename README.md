# 🛡️ DhakaSeis: AI-Driven Urban Resilience Assistant

## 🚀 The Mission: A "Digital Iron Dome" for Dhaka

Dhaka faces a critical seismic threat. This project builds a Generative AI agent capable of acting as a first-line structural consultant to democratize safety, scientifically validate risk, and provide cost-effective retrofitting roadmaps.

## 🧠 Project Dimensions (The Fellowship Roadmap)

1. **The Brain: Engineering Logic & Validation**
    - Grounded in **BNBC 2020** physics to ensure safety without AI hallucinations
    - Supports all 5 Site Classes (**SA**, **SB**, **SC**, **SD**, **SE**)

2. **The Eyes: Visual Rapid Screening**
    - Automated height and location detection using the **Overpass API** (OpenStreetMap)
    - Modular architecture ready for Computer Vision-based crack analysis

3. **The Hands: Actionable Retrofitting Roadmap**
    - Provides instant triage for threats like **Soft-Story** effects
    - Includes fair pricing models (e.g., column jacketing rates) to protect owners from price gouging

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit
- **Knowledge Engineering**: BNBC 2020 Seismic Zonation logic
